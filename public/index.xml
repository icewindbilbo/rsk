      <description>The dojo was originally formed in 1973 by Sam McKay sensei and as such is recognised as Scotland&#39;s oldest running Iaido dojo. It has seen many dojo leaders since its formation and is now managed by Robert Boyd, who took over the reigns in 2017.
Under Robert Boyd&#39;s leadership the dojo has grown both in numbers and strength and has become a pillar in the local community, not only receiving recognition from local councillors but also support in recognition of the grassroots work that the dojo does within the community.</description>
