para1: Welcome to the home page of the Tokyo Adachi Roshukai UK. We are a non-profit making martial arts club established to help promote the art of Iaido throughout the UK.

para2: Please navigate around our site to see what we do and where we are located. If you have any queries, please don't hesitate to send us an email or find us on Facebook.

para3: Iaido, pronounced ee-eye-doe and often abbreviated to iai, is a traditional Japanese martial art that can be translated as 'the art of drawing the sword', or 'the way of mental presence and immediate reaction'. Iaido emphasises being aware and capable of quickly drawing the sword and responding to a sudden attack from multiple opponents.

para4: Iaido is practiced through controlled precise movements and forms which are taught as individual techniques called kata. Although Iaido is generally non-contact consisting of solo kata against imaginary opponents and working in pairs with bokuto (wooden swords), there are some more advanced forms that include grappling techniques.

para5: At Tokyo Adachi Roshukai UK, we practice the Yamanouchi-ha Iai of Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu, but our syllabus also includes the standardised set of twelve iaido forms formulated by the All Japan Kendo Federation (Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei, ZNKR) that are taught within a number of Iaido/Kendo federations to teach and promote iaido around the world. Please see the 'About' tab for more information on the iai we study and our lineage.

para6: All our dojo are registered and insured with the British Kendo Association (BKA), which is the official governing body for Iaido in the UK.
