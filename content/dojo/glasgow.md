The dojo was originally formed in 1973 by Sam McKay sensei and as such is recognised as Scotland's oldest running Iaido dojo. It has seen many dojo leaders since its formation and is now managed by Robert Boyd, who took over the reigns in 2017.

Under Robert Boyd's leadership the dojo has grown both in numbers and strength and has become a pillar in
the local community, not only receiving recognition from local councillors but also support in recognition of the grassroots work that the dojo does within the community.

The dojo has members from coming all walks of life and nationalities. Members have enjoyed great success in
recent years at the UK National Championship and subsequently some members have gone on to represent their dojo and country at the European Iaido Championship.

The dojo practices Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu - Yamanouchi-ha, and is also a member of the British Kendo Association and practices All Japan Kendo Federation (ZNKR) Iaido.
